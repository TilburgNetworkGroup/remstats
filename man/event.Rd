event(x, variableName = NULL)

\description{
Specifies the statistic for an "event" effect in the tie-oriented model. An
"event" effect refers to an exogenous event attribute that affects the
waiting time between events.
}
\details{
The statistic at timepoint \emph{t} is for all dyads in the risk set equal
to the attribute of the event at timepoint \emph{t}.
