\usage{
outdegreeSender(scaling = c("none", "prop", "std"), consider_type = FALSE)
}
\arguments{
\item{scaling}{the method for scaling the degree statistic. Default is
to not scale the statistic (scaling = "none"). Alternatively,
scaling of the raw degree counts by the number of past events at time t can
be requested with 'prop' or standardization of the raw degree counts per
time point can be requested with 'std'.}

\item{consider_type}{logical, indicates whether to count the degrees
separately for each event type (TRUE) or sum degrees across different event
types (FALSE, default).}
}
\description{
Specifies the statistic for an `outdegreeSender` effect in the tie-oriented
model or the sender activity rate step of the actor-oriented model.
}
\details{
An outdegree of the sender effect refers to the tendency for actors to send
events if they have send more past events. The statistic at timepoint
\emph{t} for dyad \emph{(i,j)} (tie-oriented model) or sender \emph{i}
(actor-oriented model) is equal to the number of events send by
actor \emph{i} before timepoint \emph{t}. Note that the 'outdegreeSender'
effect is only defined for directed events.

Optionally, a scaling method can be set with \code{scaling}. By scaling the
degree count by the total number of past events, the statistic refers to the
fraction of past events that were send by actor i. At the first time
point, when no events did previously occur, it is assumed that every actor
is equally likely to send a message and the statistic is set equal to 1/n,
where n refers to the number of actors.
