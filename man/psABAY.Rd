\usage{
psABAY(consider_type = TRUE)
}
\arguments{
\item{consider_type}{logical, indicates whether to consider the event type
in determining which dyads create a pshift (TRUE, default) or not (FALSE).}
}
\description{
Specifies the statistic for a participation shift AB-AY.
}
\details{
One of Gibson's (2003) dyadic participation shifts. The AB-AY participation
shift refers to a tendency for \emph{turn continuing}. For directed events,
the sender (A) in the current event is the same as the sender in the
previous event (A), and the receiver (Y) is different from the previous
receiver (B). In undirected events, one of the current actors (A) matches
one of the actors in the previous events (A or B), while the other actor (Y)
is different.

To identify these shifts, a statistic 'psABAY' is calculated for each pair
of actors at a given timepoint (t). If the pair's interaction follows the
AB-AY pattern, the statistic is set equal to one; otherwise, it's set to
zero.

Additionally, the types of the AB and AY events can be taken into account. If
'consider_type' is 'TRUE', the type of the AB event and the type of the AY
event must match for the shift to occur. If 'consider_type' is 'FALSE', the
shift happens for every AY event, regardless of the event type.
