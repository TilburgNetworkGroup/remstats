\usage{
recencySendSender(consider_type = FALSE)
}
\arguments{
\item{consider_type}{logical, indicates whether to compute the recency
separately for each event type (TRUE) or regardless of event types (FALSE, 
default).}
}
\description{
Specifies the statistic for a recency send of sender effect in the 
\code{effects} argument of \code{\link{tomstats}} or the \code{rateEffects} 
argument of \code{\link{aomstats}}.
}
\details{
The recencySendSender effect refers to a recency statistic similar to what 
is described in Vu et al. (2017) and Mulder and Leenders (2019). For each 
timepoint t, for directed dyad (i,j) the statistic is equal to 1/(the time 
that has past since sender i was last active as sender + 1). Note that the 
'recencySendSender' effect is only defined for directed events.

\examples{
effects <- ~ recencySendSender()
tomstats(effects, edgelist = history)

other type of recency effects
