\usage{
tie(x, variableName = NULL, scaling = c("as.is", "std"))
}
\arguments{
\item{x}{a matrix with attribute information, rows and columns should refer
to actors in the edgelist}

\item{variableName}{optionally, a string indicating the variable name, used
for the dimnames of the output statistics object}

\item{scaling}{the method for scaling the statistic. Default is to not scale
the statistic but keep it "as.is". Alternatively, standardization of the
statistic per time point can be requested with "std".}
}
\description{
Specifies the statistic for a "tie" (or, "dyad") effect in the tie-oriented
model or the receiver choice step of the actor-oriented model. A "tie"
effect refers to an exogenous dyad attribute that affects dyad
\emph{(i,j)}'s rate of interacting (tie-oriented model) or actor \emph{j}'s
probability of being chosen as a receiver for the event send by the active
sender \emph{i} (actor-oriented model).
}
\details{
The statistic is equal to the value of the exogenous attribute for
dyad \emph{(i,j)} in matrix \code{x}.
