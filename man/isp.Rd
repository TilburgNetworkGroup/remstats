\usage{
isp(scaling = c("as.is", "std"), consider_type = FALSE)
}
\arguments{
\item{scaling}{the method for scaling the triad statistic. Default is to not 
scale the statistic but keep the raw 'counts'. Alternatively, 
standardization of the raw counts per time point can be requested 
with 'std'.}

\item{consider_type}{logical, indicates whether to count the shared partners 
separately for each event type (TRUE) or sum across different event 
types (FALSE, default).}
}
\description{
Specifies the statistic for an incoming shared partners effect in the 
\code{effects} argument of \code{\link{tomstats}} or the 
\code{choiceEffects} argument of \code{\link{aomstats}}.
}
\details{
An incoming shared partners effect refers to the tendency of dyads to 
interact if they have more past incoming shared partners between them. The 
statistic at timepoint \emph{t} for dyad \emph{(i,j)} is equal to the 
minimum of past \emph{(h,i)}, \emph{(h,j)} events, summed over all actors 
\emph{h}. Optionally, a scaling method can be set with \code{scaling}. Note 
that an 'isp' effect is only defined for directed events.

\examples{
effects <- ~ isp()
tomstats(effects, edgelist = history)
aomstats(choiceEffects = effects, edgelist = history)

undirected relational events.
