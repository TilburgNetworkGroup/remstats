\usage{
osp(unique = FALSE, scaling = c("none", "std"), consider_type = TRUE)
}
\arguments{
\item{unique}{A logical value indicating whether to sum the minimum of
events with third actors (FALSE, default) or the number of third actors that
create a new, unique shared partner (TRUE). See details for more information.}

\item{scaling}{the method for scaling the triad statistic. Default is to not
scale the statistic but keep the raw 'counts'. Alternatively,
standardization of the raw counts per time point can be requested
with 'std'.}

\item{consider_type}{logical, indicates whether to count the shared partners
separately for each event type (TRUE, default) or sum across different event
types (FALSE).}
}
\description{
Specifies the statistic for an outgoing shared partners effect.
}
\details{
The outgoing shared partners effect describes the propensity of dyads to
interact based on the number of past outgoing shared partners between them.
By default, the statistic at timepoint t for the dyad (i,j) is computed as
the sum of the minimum occurrences of past (i,h) and (j,h) events across all
actors h.

When the unique parameter is set to TRUE, a different approach is taken.
In this case, the statistic counts the number of actors h that contribute to
the creation of a new, distinct shared partner between actors i and j.

Additionally, it is possible to specify a scaling method using the scaling
parameter.

Please note that the outgoing shared partners effect, 'osp', is exclusively
defined for directed events.
