\alias{userStat}
\title{userStat}
\usage{
userStat(x, variableName = NULL)
}
\arguments{
\item{x}{Matrix with number of rows equal to the number of events and number
of columns equal to the number of dyads in the network (tie-oriented model) 
or the number of actors in the network (actor-oriented model)}

\item{variableName}{Optionally, a string with the name of the statistic.}
}
\description{
Allows the user to add its own pre-computed statistic to the statistics
object and, optionally, interact this statistic with other statistics in the
formula.
}
\examples{
\dontrun{
 reh <- remify::remify(history, model = "tie")
 actor101Events <- which(history$actor1 == "101" | history$actor2 == "101")
 actor101_stat <- t(sapply(seq_len(nrow(history)), function(i) {
   rep(i \%in\% actor101Events, reh$D)
 }))
 
 # Main effects only
 effects <- ~ userStat(x = actor101_stat, variableName = "actor101event")
 remstats(reh = reh, tie_effects = effects)
 
 # Model with interaction effects
 interaction_effects <- ~ inertia() *
   userStat(x = actor101_stat, variableName = "actor101event")
 remstats(reh = reh, tie_effects = interaction_effects)
}
