\usage{
rrankSend(consider_type = FALSE)
}
\arguments{
\item{consider_type}{logical, indicates whether to discriminate between
event types in determining the event rank (TRUE) or not (FALSE, default).}
}
\description{
Specifies the statistic for a recency rank send effect in the
\code{effects} argument of \code{\link{tomstats}} or the
\code{receiver_effects} argument of \code{\link{aomstats}}.
}
\details{
The rrankSend effect refers to a rank-based recency effect, as described in
section 2.2.5 of Butts (2008). For each timepoint t, for directed dyad (i,j)
the statistic is equal to the inverse of the rank of receiver j among the
actors to which sender i has most recently send past events. Note that the
'rrankSend' effect is only defined for directed events.

\examples{
library(remify)
rehObject <- reh(history)
effects <- ~ rrankSend()
remstats(tie_effects = effects, reh = rehObject)
remstats(receiver_effects = effects, reh = rehObject)
tomstats(effects, reh = rehObject)
aomstats(receiver_effects = effects, reh = rehObject)
