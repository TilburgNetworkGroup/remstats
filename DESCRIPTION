Description: Butts' (2008) relational event model allows researchers to    
    investigate the exogenous and endogenous predictors of how a time-ordered 
    sequence of relational events (a relational event history) evolves over 
    time. This package is developed to assist researchers in applying 
    relational event modeling to their own data: it computes a range of 
    exogenous and endogenous statistics for relational event history data.
