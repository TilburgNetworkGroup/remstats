Description: Relational event modeling approaches enable researchers to study 
    the exogenous and endogenous predictors of how a time-ordered sequence of 
    relational events - a so-called relational event history - evolves over 
    time. Relational event models can be distinguished in "tie-oriented 
    models" and "actor-oriented models". The `R`-package `remstats` computes a 
    variety of statistics for both type of models.
