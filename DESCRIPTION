Description: The 'remstats' package is designed to compute a variety of statistics for relational event models. Relational event modeling approaches enable researchers to investigate both exogenous and endogenous factors influencing the evolution of a time-ordered sequence of relational events. These models are categorized into tie-oriented models, where the probability of a dyad interacting next is modeled in a single step, and actor-oriented models, which first model the probability of a sender initiating an interaction and subsequently the probability of the senders' choice of receiver. The 'remstats' package is designed to compute a variety of statistics that characterize exogenous and endogenous influences on the event stream for both types of models.
