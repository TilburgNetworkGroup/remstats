Description: Relational event modeling approaches enable researchers to study 
    the exogenous and endogenous predictors of how a time-ordered sequence of 
    relational events - a so-called relational event history - evolves over 
    time. Relational event models can be distinguished in "tie-oriented 
    models", in which the probability of a dyad to interact next is modeled in 
    one step (e.g., see Butts, 2008), and "actor-oriented models", in which 
    first the probability of a sender to start an interaction is modeled and 
    subsequently the probability of the choice of a receiver of the interaction 
    by the active sender (e.g., see Stadtfeld & Block, 2017). The `R`-package 
    `remstats` computes a variety of statistics for both type of models.
