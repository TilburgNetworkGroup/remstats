Description: Computes a variety of statistics for relational event models. Relational event models enable researchers to investigate both exogenous and endogenous factors influencing the evolution of a time-ordered sequence of events. These models are categorized into tie-oriented models (Butts, C., 2008, <doi:10.1111/j.1467-9531.2008.00203.x>), where the probability of a dyad interacting next is modeled in a single step, and actor-oriented models (Stadtfeld, C., & Block, P., 2017, <doi:10.15195/v4.a14>), which first model the probability of a sender initiating an interaction and subsequently the probability of the sender's choice of receiver. The package is designed to compute a variety of statistics that summarize exogenous and endogenous influences on the event stream for both types of models.
